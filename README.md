## Programming Language

We thoroughly used **Rust** for writing solvers, visualizers, a web server, and tools.

## Approaches

### Overview

TBA

## Infrastructure

### Computational infrastructure

Our solution for this year does not require a large number of runs.
We did not proceed with automation that required hundreds of instances.
Thanks to Rust, we safely parallelized our solution.
Our program runs faster with more CPUs, so we worked on machines with 224 vCPUs.

### Services

We used Discord, Github Copilot, ChatGPT, Google Workspace, GitHub, and Pipedream.
